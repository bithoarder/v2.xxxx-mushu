# [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer) profile for my V2.4 #

This profile is set up as a vendor profile, and is mainly bould around [Docs](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/slicer_profiles/PrusaSlicer/Doc_250_V22_AB.ini) and [Andrew Ellis](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-PIF-Profile) PIF profiles.

The filament profiles have extrusion multipliers and pressure advance configurations that are specific to my printer.
